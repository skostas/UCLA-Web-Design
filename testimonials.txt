Flora's is great! Everytime I come into the shop, she remembers me and my style. Not only does this remind me how much she cares about her clients, but also it make it so much easier to work with her because she understands my vision from the beginning!

I have not used a Florist other than Flora in 10 year. Her prices are unbeatable and the quality of her work is consistently impeccable!

Flora is very fair. There was a mix up with my order, and Flora immediately resolved the problem and covered all costs.

I used Flora's for my wedding, and she did not disappoint. The arrangments were beautiful and exactly as we had discussed. Flora and her staff were very professional, making sure all arrangments were were they needed to be before schedule and reaffirming with me beforehand when and where everything should be delivered.
